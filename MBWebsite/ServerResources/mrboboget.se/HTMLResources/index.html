        This is the personal website of me, Emanuel Berggren aka MrBoboGet. <br><br>

        
        It started as a way to learn more about how web servers are actually
        implemented, with the goal of being able to store and categorize funny
        videos to send in discord, but quickly evolved beyond that simple goal.
        Now it's used a general store for files and as a media server.<br><br>


        This also means that most of the functionality is locked behind login,
        as copyrighted data is stored. The site does however provide a public
        API for other functionality that is used both by 
        <a href="https://github.com/MrBoboGet/MBPacketManager">MBPacketManager</a>
        and 
        <a href="https://github.com/MrBoboGet/MBRadio">MBRadio</a>. It also serves
        as a host alongside github for the documentation for my various
        projects, and can be accessed <a
            href="/DB/Documentation//index.html">here</a>.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        
        The backend is written in C++ by me, except for the encryption routines.
        This includes both a HTTP server as well as a TLS 1.2 implementation, and
        is self hosted on a raspberry pi. The code can be found at 
        <a href="https://github.com/MrBoboGet/MrBoboWeb">MrBoboWeb</a>, and
        is split between the different subdirectories MBCrypto, MrPostOGet, and
        MBWebsite.
